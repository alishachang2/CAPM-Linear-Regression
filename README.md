# CAPM-Linear-Regression
A project for Linear Algebra and Probability, where we modeled CAPM through linear regression, specifically using orthogonal projection. Using orthogonal projections, we project data points onto a subspace to minimize error. Using matrix transformations made for a cleaner and scalable implementation—while also adding to what we learned in class!
